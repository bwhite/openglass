Mirror Holder
=============

Lets you see your hands for gestures and ASL from the camera.
Made using these mirrors (http://www.amazon.com/dp/B000YQK4KQ/ref=pe_385040_30332190_pe_175190_21431760_3p_M3T1_ST1_dp_1)

Eye Tracker
===========

Used to track pupil position.  Use disassembly instructions at (https://code.google.com/p/pupil/wiki/Camera_Modifications) for the HD-6000.  I didn't add the filter and instead of using the auto focus I rotated it 180deg so that it didn't connect but kept the leads (the auto focus is symmetric).  Thanks to the Pupil project (https://code.google.com/p/pupil/ led by Moritz Kassner) for the idea and great instructions.  This is compatible with the pupil tracker there but I have a custom tracker that I wrote that works about the same but is simpler (going to be incorporated into the Android code directly, though it is currently in Python).

Cover
=====
Covers the outside of the prism to improve viewability in sunlight.  Fits snugly to ensure a tight fit (e.g., for running).
